# Hey! I'm Josue Ruiz.
**I'm a Full Stack developer.**

ðŸ’¬ I'm from Costa Rica. I love working in application development. I love what I do.

ðŸŽ“ I studied "*InformÃ¡tica empresarial*" in University of Costa Rica. Some of my projects were carried out there.

ðŸ’» I keep learning day by day, about Framework and librery, because I think that, my furute is in my hands.
